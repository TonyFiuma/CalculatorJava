Create a class called "Calculator" with the following methods:

add(double a, double b) - which returns the sum of "a" and "b"
subtract(double a, double b) - which returns the difference of "a" and "b"
multiply(double a, double b) - which returns the product of "a" and "b"
divide(double a, double b) - which returns the ratio of "a" and "b"
modulus(double a, double b) - which returns the remainder of integer division of "a" and "b"
Create a class called "TestCalculator" with a method main. In this method, create an object of type Calculator e
uses the methods to perform some basic operations, printing the results.

Extend the Calculator class to support advanced operations, such as:

power(double a, double b) - which returns "a" raised to "b"
root(double a, double b) - which returns the bth root of "a"
logarithm(double a, double b) - which returns the base "b" logarithm of "a"
Modify the TestCalculator class to verify that the added methods work correctly.

This is just one example and there are many other things you can do to extend this exercise, but it should
give you an idea of ​​how to create a program in Java that uses classes and methods to implement a calculator.
